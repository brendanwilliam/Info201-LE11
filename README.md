# **Lecture Exercise 11**
**Author:** Brendan Keane

**Date:** February 9th, 2022

### This is the first section of this Exercise
Here I am going to put some text just as a placeholder. Then I will push this to GitHub and then fork my current branch.

I am going to add to this branch, but also change some text. This is being created by my second account, and I will make a merge conflict happen because I am crazy like that.


### 1) What is something that you found interesting in this exercise set (or why nothing interesting)?

I think that GitHub is such a powerful tool for collaboration, but it also _requires project coordination._ For large projects, I understand why there is a full-time role dedicated to a **project manager**.

### 2) What was something that you found challenging in this exercise set (or why nothing challenging)?

I always find GitHub helpful until it isn't. While this exercise wasn't too difficult, I've had some terrible experiences with accidentally working on a different branch, accidentally forking a branch, and then dealing with a ton of merge conflicts that break the code I was working on.
